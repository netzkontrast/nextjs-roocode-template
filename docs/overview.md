# Repository Overview

## Organization

This repository is a Next.js application template structured to support a rigorous AI-assisted development workflow. It is organized to facilitate collaboration between human developers and AI agents acting in specific roles.

### Key Directories

- **`.clinerules*` & `.roomodes`**: Configuration files that define the AI agent personas (Project Manager, Architect, Code, PMO) and their specific rules of engagement.
- **`src/`**: The source code of the Next.js application.
  - **`app/`**: Next.js App Router structure.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components.
  - **`env/`**: Environment variable validation logic.
  - **`lib/`**: Utility functions.
- **`memory-bank/`**: (Mentioned in rules) Likely a place for persistent context or documentation.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation generated by the agents (Requirements, Architecture, etc.).

## Unique Ideas & Concepts

### 1. Mode-Based AI Workflow
The repository defines distinct "modes" for the AI agent, mimicking a software development team structure:
- **PM (Project Manager)**: Manages high-level requirements, progress, and task breakdown.
- **Architect**: Translates requirements into technical design, directory structure, and component architecture.
- **Code**: Implements the design with specific coding standards and testing requirements.
- **PMO (Project Management Office)**: Acts as a quality assurance role, ensuring that the other modes follow the rules defined in `.clinerules`.

### 2. Explicit Hand-offs
The workflow enforces explicit hand-offs between roles. For example, the PM creates a requirement list, which the Architect uses to create a design document, which the Coder uses to implement. This reduces "context soup" and ensures each step is verified.

### 3. "YARRR!" Confirmation
A unique rule requires the agent to respond with "YARRR!" to confirm understanding of the prompt and rules, serving as a ritualistic check for context retention.

### 4. Confidence Scoring
The agent is required to state a confidence score (0-10) before and after tool usage and major actions. This promotes self-reflection and helps identifying when the agent is "hallucinating" or unsure.

### 5. Colocation & Feature Grouping
The architecture rules heavily favor "colocation", where tests, types, hooks, and components for a specific feature are grouped together in the same directory, rather than being scattered by file type.

### 6. Strict Leashes
The rules include strict prohibitions (e.g., "Do not read .env files") and mandatory pre-commit checks (lefthook), ensuring security and code quality are not bypassed by the AI.
